# Oblect-recognizer-using-Keras-inceptionV3-Image-classigication-model
This is a simple image recognizer which uses Keras inceptionV3, a  pre trained model to identify different objects
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

For this project we use a pre trained image classification model called 'inceptionV3'.

InceptionV3 model was trained using the ImageNet Database which is a large image database consist of around hundred and thousands of images which divied into several categories.
